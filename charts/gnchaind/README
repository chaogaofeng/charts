# gnchaind node

The gnchain node chart is designed to be a full featured chart for running a gnchaind daemon.

## Deployments

### Basic

The basic install provides a pvc for the datastore and generates temporary secrets for the p2p identify. 
Therefore deleteing the pod results in loss of these secrets. For this reason we recommend
that secrets are generated externally and a secret named is supplied.

```
helm upgrade --install gnchain ./gnchaind
```
